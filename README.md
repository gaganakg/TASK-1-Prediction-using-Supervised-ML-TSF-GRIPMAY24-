## Predicting Student Scores based on Study Hours

This repository contains the code for a simple linear regression model developed as part of my internship with The Sparks Foundation (#GRIPMAY24). The objective of this project is to predict students' scores based on the number of study hours, using Python's Scikit-Learn library for machine learning.

### Overview:
- **Data Source**: The dataset used in this project contains information on the number of study hours and the corresponding scores of students.
- **Data Visualization**: Before training the model, the data is visualized using a scatter plot to understand the relationship between study hours and scores.
- **Model Training**: The linear regression model is trained on the dataset to learn the relationship between study hours and scores.
- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-squared.

### How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook (ipynb file) to see the code in action.
3. Explore the code and results to understand how the model predicts student scores based on study hours.
